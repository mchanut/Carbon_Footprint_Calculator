### **Methodology applied for the evaluation**

&nbsp;

##### 1/ Calculation of the carbon footprint of washing/sterilization steps. The following emissions were taken into account:
- Pre-disinfection. Cleaning by soaking or with one or more disinfectant wipes and consideration of the carbon footprint of the wipe and the disinfectant liquid.
- Use of a washing-disinfection machine (15 DIN baskets). Consideration of the following emission items: electricity, water, construction of the washer-disinfector, staff commuting, laundry consumables (detergents, gloves, masks, etc.), filling rate. For medical devices sterilized in reusable boxes, 2 washing-disinfection cycles are counted for one sterilization cycle.
- Sterilization in autoclave (8 standardized baskets). Consideration of the following emission items: electricity, water, construction of the sterilizer, staff commuting, laundry consumables (gloves, masks, caps, pajamas, etc.), sterilization packaging, including their end of life, filling rate.

##### 2/ Calculation of the carbon footprint of the medical device:
- TThe assessment was carried out using an EEIO (Environmentally Extended Input Output) approach given the wide variety of MDs that can be reused. The “Manufacture of medical, precision and optical instruments, watches and clocks” emission factor from the Exiobase database (2022) was selected, with a value available for 49 geographical areas (countries or group of countries), which were grouped in the 5 geographical areas of the form. These economic emission factors have been modulated according to the complexity/added value of each MD, to range from 0.03 to 1.00 kgCO2eq/€ (vs. 0.09 to 0.80 for the main countries producers). This method presents a higher uncertainty than the Life Cycle Assessment but makes it possible to automatically process the wide variety of medical devices. The end of life has been taken into account for single use, but not for reusable devices given that it is precisely reused a large number of times, and that the end of life is often negligible (which implies that the choice of the main material of the reusable DM has no impact in this first version). Ecovamed being specialized in Life Cycle and Carbon Footprint Assessments of health products, do not hesitate to contact us if you wish to carry out an LCA of a specific medical device, or of a family of devices.
